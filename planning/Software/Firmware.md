## Firmware tasks

These are optional enhancements for LoRa MIMO applications unless otherwise noted in the TX path. None of the RX-only tasks below may be a single point of failure for baseline reception.

| Task | Trigger | Latency budget |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weight computation override (ALMMSE / EMA / custom SW policy) | `training_done` IRQ (`IRQ_TRAINING_DONE`) | < 2.2 ms at SF6/125 kHz (~70,400 cycles) |
| TX preparation (RX→TX) | `tx_prep` IRQ from TX_CTRL[0] | < 1 ms (LoRaWAN RX1 budget = 1 s) |
| TX restore (TX→RX) | `tx_done` IRQ from TX_CTRL[1] | < 1 ms |
| AGC loop | `corr_lock` IRQ (`IRQ_CORR_LOCK`) | < 1 packet |
| SX1257 init on power-up | Startup when CPU-managed mode is used | Before first RX |

### Weight computation override

Triggered by `IRQ_TRAINING_DONE` only when the software path is intentionally being used. In the baseline hardware RX path, PicoRV32 does not need to service this interrupt; hardware weight generation already computes and commits the default MRC weights.

When software override is enabled, firmware reads Z_j scaled readback registers (`0x70`–`0x8F`), computes combining weights for the active mode, writes W_SHADOW (`0x90`–`0xAF`), then pulses W_COMMIT.

Z_j are exposed as int32 (right-shifted by `Z_SHIFT` from register `0xB3`). The common shift preserves relative magnitudes and phases — no division by n_acc needed.

```c
// Read Z_j_scaled (int32 I+Q per branch, big-endian) from 0x70-0x8F
// Apply calibration: H_j = Z_j * conj(cal_j)   (complex multiply, Q1.15 cal)
// Then compute weights by mode:

// MRC: w_j = conj(H_j) / S,  S = Σ_k |H_k|²
int64 S = 0;
for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++)
    S += (int64)H_re[j]*H_re[j] + (int64)H_im[j]*H_im[j];
for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
    W_re[j] = (int16)((int64)H_re[j] * 32767 / S);   // Q1.15 normalise
    W_im[j] = (int16)(-(int64)H_im[j] * 32767 / S);  // conjugate
}

// EGC: w_j = conj(H_j) / |H_j|  (unit magnitude, conjugate phase)
// SC:  w_j = 1 for argmax_j |H_j|², 0 for others
// Bypass: w_j = 1 for lowest enabled antenna, 0 for others
```

After writing W_SHADOW and pulsing W_COMMIT, the Packet Control FSM promotes W_SHADOW → W_ACTIVE at the next `safe_switch` (IDLE boundary). See [Weight Generation](Weight%20Generation.md) for full arithmetic detail.

### TX preparation (RX → TX)

Triggered by `tx_prep` IRQ (host writes `TX_CTRL[0]=1`). Disables RX on TX antennas before switching them to transmit, preventing corrupted inputs reaching the combiner.

```c
void tx_prep_handler() {
    // 1. Gate TX antennas out of combiner immediately
    uint8_t ctrl = read_reg(MIMO_CTRL);
    write_reg(MIMO_CTRL, ctrl & ~0b11110000);  // clear ANTENNA_EN[0:1]
                                                // (antennas 2,3 remain active)

    // 2. Put SX1257_3/4 to standby (StandbyEnable only = 0x01)
    //    Stops SX1257_3/4 outputting corrupt IQ during TX window
    spi_master_write(2, REG_MODE, 0x01);  // SX1257_3 standby
    spi_master_write(3, REG_MODE, 0x01);  // SX1257_4 standby

    // 3. Switch SX1257_1/2 to TX (PADriverEnable|TxEnable|StandbyEnable = 0x0D)
    spi_master_write(0, REG_MODE, 0x0D);  // SX1257_1 TX
    spi_master_write(1, REG_MODE, 0x0D);  // SX1257_2 TX
    // ~12 µs SPI (4 writes) + 120 µs TS_TR; well within 1 s RX1 budget

    // 4. Mark TX active; clear IRQ; signal RPi
    write_reg(TX_CTRL, 0x04);  // TX_ACTIVE=1, TX_PREP=0
    clear_irq(IRQ_TX_PREP);
}
```

**W recomputation not required.** During TX the SX1302 is transmitting — it does not process the ASIC re-mod output. Combined output quality during TX is irrelevant.

**SE2435L LNA protection.** Standby on SX1257_3/4 stops corrupt IQ data reaching the ASIC. SE2435L_3/4 CPS (LNA enable) is a separate signal whose source is TBD — see [SE2435L Front-End Module](SE2435L%20Front-End%20Module.md) for the open decision. If CPS cannot be driven low during TX, the LNA may compress at −13 dBm input (40 dB board isolation, +27 dBm TX); safe only if board isolation >37 dB.

### TX restore (TX → RX)

Triggered by `tx_done` IRQ (host writes `TX_CTRL[1]=1` after `lgw_send()` completes).

```c
void tx_done_handler() {
    // 1. Switch SX1257_1/2 back to RX (RxEnable|StandbyEnable = 0x03)
    spi_master_write(0, REG_MODE, 0x03);  // SX1257_1 RX
    spi_master_write(1, REG_MODE, 0x03);  // SX1257_2 RX

    // 2. Restore SX1257_3/4 to RX
    spi_master_write(2, REG_MODE, 0x03);  // SX1257_3 RX
    spi_master_write(3, REG_MODE, 0x03);  // SX1257_4 RX

    // 3. Wait TS_RE — SX1257 standby/TX → RX wake-up (typ 100 µs)
    delay_us(150);  // conservative margin; covers all 4 SX1257s

    // 5. Re-enable all antennas
    uint8_t ctrl = read_reg(MIMO_CTRL);
    write_reg(MIMO_CTRL, ctrl | 0b11110000);  // restore ANTENNA_EN[0:1]

    // 6. Clear TX_ACTIVE; clear IRQ
    write_reg(TX_CTRL, 0x00);
    clear_irq(IRQ_TX_DONE);

    // 7. Invalidate W — correlator will recompute on next preamble
    //    (channel may have changed while TX antennas were gated)
    w_valid = 0;
}
```

**Note on W invalidation.** After TX, the channel estimate from before TX may be stale. Setting `w_valid=0` causes the combiner to coast on the old W until the next correlator lock recomputes it. For a static gateway this is fine; channel coherence time >> TX window duration.

### Flat-fading-per-packet assumption

The design assumes the channel is constant across one packet — `h_hat` estimated from the preamble is applied unchanged to the payload. This holds when the channel coherence time >> packet duration.

**When the assumption can break:**

| Scenario | Risk | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile node (walking, ~1.5 m/s, 868 MHz) | Coherence time ~200 ms | SF12 packets (~2.5 s) exceed this; SF7 (~50 ms) is safe |
| Dense urban / industrial multipath | High Doppler spread | Even slow nodes can see fast fading |
| SF12 at 125 kHz | Highest risk | 2.5 s exposure — longest packet by far |
| SF7–SF9 static sensors | Negligible | Packets short enough for assumption to hold comfortably |

**Impact:** If the channel changes between preamble and payload, `h_hat` is stale. MRC degrades gracefully (loses some combining gain) rather than failing catastrophically — the argmax demodulator is robust to partial phase misalignment.

**EMA interaction:** The cross-packet EMA averaging makes staleness worse for mobile nodes by blending old channel estimates into the current one. EMA should be disabled (`ALPHA_SHIFT=0`) or given a very short window for mobile deployments.

**Verification implication:** BER vs SNR sweeps should include a time-varying channel test at SF12 to characterise the degradation boundary.

### Channel estimate averaging (EMA)

Z_j is estimated once per preamble. On a stable channel this is sufficient; on a slowly varying channel, averaging Z_j across packets reduces noise on the channel estimate and stabilises weights.

Firmware implements an exponential moving average of the normalised channel estimate H_j (= Z_j_scaled, the int32 right-shifted value from registers) in DMEM — no RTL changes required:

```c
// DMEM: 32 bytes for H_prev (int32 I+Q per branch)
int32_t H_prev_re[4], H_prev_im[4];

// IRQ_STATUS bits (non-FFT path):
#define IRQ_CORR_LOCK        (1u << 0)
#define IRQ_TRAINING_DONE    (1u << 1)
#define IRQ_W_MISSED_PACKET  (1u << 2)
#define IRQ_PACKET_DONE      (1u << 3)

void irq_handler() {
    uint8_t irq = read_reg(IRQ_STATUS);

    if (irq & IRQ_CORR_LOCK) {
        agc_update();
        clear_irq(IRQ_CORR_LOCK);
    }

    if (irq & IRQ_TRAINING_DONE) {
        // Saturation check: if any antenna was saturating, discard this packet
        bool saturated = false;
        for (int n = 0; n < 4; n++)
            if (read_energy(n) > AGC_SAT_GUARD) { saturated = true; break; }

        if (!saturated) {
            read_Zj_registers(H_new_re, H_new_im);  // Z_j_scaled from 0x70-0x8F

            // EMA: reset if any antenna's gain changed (Z_j scales with gain)
            if (ema_reset_pending) {
                memcpy(H_prev_re, H_new_re, sizeof(H_prev_re));
                memcpy(H_prev_im, H_new_im, sizeof(H_prev_im));
                ema_reset_pending = false;
            } else {
                // H_avg = H_prev + (H_new - H_prev) >> ALPHA_SHIFT
                for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
                    H_prev_re[j] += (H_new_re[j] - H_prev_re[j]) >> ALPHA_SHIFT;
                    H_prev_im[j] += (H_new_im[j] - H_prev_im[j]) >> ALPHA_SHIFT;
                }
            }

            compute_W(H_prev_re, H_prev_im);  // uses active combining mode
            write_W_shadow_registers(W);       // to 0x90-0xAF
            write_reg(WGT_CTRL, 1u << 4);   // pulse W_COMMIT
        }

        clear_irq(IRQ_TRAINING_DONE);
    }

    if (irq & IRQ_W_MISSED_PACKET) {
        stats.w_missed++;
        clear_irq(IRQ_W_MISSED_PACKET);
    }
}
```

`ALPHA_SHIFT` is a firmware compile-time constant. To disable averaging set `ALPHA_SHIFT=0`.

Per-branch noise floor estimation is handled by the **Noise Floor Estimator** RTL block (see [Noise Floor Estimator](Noise%20Floor%20Estimator.md)), not by firmware. Firmware uses the hardware estimates via `SIGMA2_SRC=HW` (default) or supplies override values via `SIGMA2_SHADOW` registers if needed.

**Timing:** Weight computation (MRC path including 1/S division) ~50 cycles at 32 MHz. Budget from `training_done` to payload start is ~70,400 cycles at SF6/125 kHz — margin >1000×.


### AGC loop

Triggered at each `IRQ_STATUS.CORR_LOCK`, independent of the later `IRQ_STATUS.TRAINING_DONE` W-computation path. Reads per-antenna energy latched at preamble lock by the Energy Measurement and adjusts each SX1257's `RegRxAnaGain` (0x0C) independently.

**SX1257 RegRxAnaGain (0x0C) layout:**

| Bits | Field | Range | Step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [7:5] | `RxLnaGain` | 1 (G1, max) – 6 (G6, min) | 6 dB for G1–G3; **12 dB** for G3–G6 |
| [4:1] | `RxBbGain` | 0 (min) – 15 (max) | 2 dB (gain = −24 + 2×val dB) |
| [0] | `LnaZin` | keep 0 (50 Ω) | — |

Note: `RxLnaGain` is inverted — a higher register value means less gain (G1=0 dB ref, G2=−6, G3=−12, G4=−24, G5=−36, G6=−48 dB). Steps are **non-uniform**: 6 dB between G1–G3, 12 dB between G3–G6. Total range: 48 dB (LNA) + 30 dB (BB) = 78 dB; spec quotes 70 dB usable.

**Control strategy:** Use BB gain for fine tracking (±2 dB/packet). Step LNA gain only when BB hits its limit, restoring BB to mid-scale to maintain headroom. Note that a single LNA step near G3/G4 is 12 dB — if crossing that boundary, two BB steps will not fully compensate; convergence may take 2 packets instead of 1.

```c
// RegRxAnaGain bit packing
#define LNA_G1  1   // maximum LNA gain (0 dB ref)
#define LNA_G6  6   // minimum LNA gain (−48 dB)
#define BB_MAX  15  // maximum BB gain
#define BB_MIN  0   // minimum BB gain
#define BB_MID  7   // restore point after LNA step

// Energy thresholds (ENERGY register: int16 unsigned, Σ|x|² over 8 symbols)
#define AGC_TARGET_LO  0x0800   // ~3%  of full scale — increase gain
#define AGC_TARGET_HI  0x6000   // ~38% of full scale — decrease gain
#define AGC_SAT_GUARD  0xE000   // ~88% of full scale — emergency LNA step

// Start at full gain (G1 + BB_MAX) for maximum sensitivity on the first packet.
// Weak/distant nodes may only just trigger correlator lock — any gain reduction
// at startup risks missing them entirely. Strong-signal saturation is handled
// by discarding corrupted H estimates rather than reducing starting gain.
// Host may override via RX_GAIN_SHADOW_n + RX_GAIN_COMMIT before releasing CPU_RESET.
static uint8_t lna_gain[4] = {LNA_G1,  LNA_G1,  LNA_G1,  LNA_G1};
static uint8_t bb_gain[4]  = {BB_MAX,  BB_MAX,  BB_MAX,  BB_MAX};
bool ema_reset_pending = false;  // set when any gain changes; consumed by irq_handler

static void agc_write(int n) {
    uint8_t reg = (lna_gain[n] << 5) | (bb_gain[n] << 1);  // LnaZin=0
    spi_master_write(n, 0x0C, reg);
    write_reg(RX_GAIN_SHADOW_0 + n, reg);
    write_reg(RX_GAIN_CTRL, 0x01);  // RX_GAIN_COMMIT pulse; safe apply at next idle boundary
}

void agc_update() {
    if (read_reg(TX_CTRL) & 0x04) return;  // skip during TX window

    for (int n = 0; n < 4; n++) {
        uint16_t e = read_energy(n);
        bool changed = true;

        if (e > AGC_SAT_GUARD) {
            // Saturation: step LNA down immediately (−6 dB), restore BB to mid
            if      (lna_gain[n] < LNA_G6)  { lna_gain[n]++; bb_gain[n] = BB_MID; }
            else if (bb_gain[n]  > BB_MIN)   { bb_gain[n] = BB_MIN; }
            else                             { changed = false; }  // already at floor
        } else if (e > AGC_TARGET_HI) {
            // Too hot: reduce BB by 2 dB; step LNA if BB exhausted
            if      (bb_gain[n] > BB_MIN)    { bb_gain[n]--; }
            else if (lna_gain[n] < LNA_G6)   { lna_gain[n]++; bb_gain[n] = BB_MAX; }
            else                             { changed = false; }
        } else if (e < AGC_TARGET_LO) {
            // Too cold: increase BB by 2 dB; step LNA if BB exhausted
            if      (bb_gain[n] < BB_MAX)    { bb_gain[n]++; }
            else if (lna_gain[n] > LNA_G1)   { lna_gain[n]--; bb_gain[n] = BB_MIN; }
            else                             { changed = false; }
        } else {
            changed = false;  // within window
        }

        if (changed) { agc_write(n); ema_reset_pending = true; }
    }
}
```

**Convergence.** Starting at G1+BB_MAX gives maximum sensitivity for weak first packets. For a saturating close-range node, `AGC_SAT_GUARD` steps the LNA immediately and H is discarded for that packet — the combiner coasts on the previous W (or waits for the first clean packet if no prior W exists). Fine tracking once in the target window converges in 1–2 packets. For a known deployment, pre-set `RX_GAIN_SHADOW_n` via SPI and pulse `RX_GAIN_COMMIT` before releasing `CPU_RESET` to skip convergence entirely.

**No-packets limitation.** AGC only runs at correlator lock — between packets, gain is frozen at its current setting. This is intentional: maximum gain during silence maximises the chance of detecting the next transmission. The saturation-discard path handles the first strong packet cleanly without reducing idle sensitivity.

**Interaction with W.** Gain changes take effect at the start of the next packet. H and N₀ are latched at correlator lock so they are always self-consistent within a packet — no mid-packet gain shift occurs.

**EMA invalidation on gain change.** H scales with receive gain, so `H_prev` (estimated at gain G_N) and `H_new` (at gain G_{N+1}) are not comparable. If any antenna's gain changed this packet, set `ema_reset_pending = true`. On the following correlator lock, skip the EMA and seed `H_prev = H_new` directly, then clear the flag. This ensures the EMA only ever averages estimates from the same gain setting.

**TX guard.** `agc_update()` returns immediately if `TX_ACTIVE` is set. Energy latched during TX is meaningless (combiner has gated antennas 0/1 and antennas 2/3 are receiving TX leakage, not node signal).

**Threshold calibration.** `AGC_TARGET_LO / AGC_TARGET_HI` are initial values; calibrate on silicon against measured ADC output levels from the decimator. `AGC_SAT_GUARD` should be set just below the int8 decimator output saturation point.
