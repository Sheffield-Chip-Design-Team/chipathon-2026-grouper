# UART Verification Plan

**Design doc:** [UART](../../design/blocks/UART.md)
**Source:** [Schematic Review](../../Schematic%20Review.md) §5 "Verification Summary" — block-level testbench architecture (UART VIP ↔ DUT ↔ AHB VIP ↔ Scoreboard).
**DV status:** Most-mature block. `hw/dv/ahb_uart/` (pyuvm test + sequences) and `hw/dv/uvc/uart/`, `hw/dv/uvc/ahb3lite/` (reusable UVCs) already exist. `hw/tb/uart_wtb.sv` is a standalone directed testbench.

## Testbench Architecture

Per the Schematic Review's block-level testbench diagram: **UART VIP (active) ↔ UART (DUT) ↔ AHB VIP (active)**, feeding a **Scoreboard**.

 The AHB agent Drives + Monitors CPU-side register transactions; the UART RX agent drives/monitors the RX serial pin wheras the TX agent just monitors the tx pin passively.

## Verification Components Needed

| Component | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AHB3Lite Agent (driver/monitor/sequencer/item) | **Exists** — `hw/dv/uvc/ahb3lite/` | Reuse as-is. |
| UART Agent (driver/monitor/sequencer/item) | **Exists** — `hw/dv/uvc/uart/` | Reuse as-is; drives/monitors `uart_tx`/`uart_rx` at the serial-bit level. |
| UART env (wires agents together) | **Exists** — `hw/dv/ahb_uart/tbench/ahb_uart_env.py` | Note: this file currently imports from `hw.dv.ahb3.*`, a path that doesn't match the real `hw/dv/uvc/ahb3lite/` |
| Scoreboard / reference model | **TODO** | No scoreboard exists anywhere in `hw/dv/` yet. For UART this needs to: (a) mirror the 4-register `CTRL`/`STATUS`/`TXDATA`/`RXDATA` map from AHB transactions, (b) independently model FIFO fill/empty/full state and baud timing from `CLK_DIV`, (c) compare bytes driven on `uart_rx` against bytes popped via `RXDATA` reads, and bytes pushed via `TXDATA` against bytes observed on `uart_tx`. |
| Functional coverage collector | **Missing** | New — see `V-UART-COV-*` below. |

## Testscases

- **`UartSanityTest`** (exists — `hw/dv/ahb_uart/tests/uart_test.py`): basic configuration, receive data and then send data ( simple ASCII messages). (Not full duplex)'
- **`UartFullDuplexTest`** : basic configuration, receive data and then send data ( simple ASCII messages). (Not full duplex)'
- **`UartResetTest`** : advanced configuration, full-duplex data transmission, resets mid-transmission.
- **`UartErrorInjectTest`** : advanced configuration (different test cases), full duplex.'
        - **Baud-rate sweep**: parametrize `CLK_DIV` across corner + random values, verify measured bit period (`V-UART-STM-008`/`COV-003`).
        - **Framing-error injection**: force a bad start/stop bit via the UART agent driver, verify `RX_FRAME_ERROR`/`RX_BREAK` (`V-UART-STM-006`/`CHK-007`).
        - **Illegal-access**: writes to `STATUS`/`RXDATA`, write-while-full, read-while-empty — confirm `HRESP` error and no corruption (`V-UART-STM-003/004/005`).
- **`UartRandomTest`** : chaos.'

## Open Items
- UVM-style testcases just fail.
- The random sequences don't seem to really work that concurrently.
- Is the 'UVM' methodology creep too heavy? can I simplifiy the reg model + randomness etc
- The Monitor warns about bad start and stop bits - this should not be the case.
- Currently the checks are in the sequences (bad UVM separation of concerns)
- No scoreboard exists yet — this blocks every `CHK` item above from actually running; building it is the top DV priority for this block.
- `hw/dv/ahb_uart/tbench/ahb_uart_env.py` imports from a stale `hw.dv.ahb3` path — needs fixing to point at `hw/dv/uvc/ahb3lite/` before new tests are layered on top.
- No committed cocotb runner/Makefile for this flow (see the top-level `CLAUDE.md`) — needed before any of the above tests can actually be executed in CI or locally in a repeatable way.
- No coverage yet + No Scoreboard
